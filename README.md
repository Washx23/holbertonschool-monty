Monty is an interpreter for a programming language that operates on a stack-based data structure. It reads a file containing Monty bytecode instructions and executes them one by one.

Let's consider a simple Monty program that adds two numbers:

perl
Copy code
push 10
push 5
add
pall
The push instruction is used to add values to the stack. In this example, we push the values 10 and 5 onto the stack.
The add instruction takes the top two elements from the stack, adds them together, and replaces them with the result.
The pall instruction prints all the elements in the stack.
To execute this program, we would create a file (let's call it program.monty) containing these instructions. Then, we can run Monty and provide the file as an argument:

shell
Copy code
$ ./monty program.monty
Monty would read the instructions from the file, execute them, and produce the following output:

Copy code
15
In this case, 15 is the result of adding 10 and 5.

Monty supports various other instructions like pop (removes the top element from the stack), swap (swaps the positions of the top two elements), pint (prints the value at the top of the stack), and more. These instructions allow you to manipulate and perform calculations on the stack.

Overall, Monty provides a simple and intuitive stack-based programming language, where you can push values onto the stack, perform operations on them, and retrieve or print the results.
